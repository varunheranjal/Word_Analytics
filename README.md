# Word_Analytics
A simple yet useful Word/Character Counter application which counts and displays the Number of 'Words' and 'Characters' that are available in the Sentences that you type.
I have also added in an Additional Logic to count the Number of words/characters for a Twitter and Facebook post so that You can be aware of the max limit allowed in each. 

Check it out and kindly provide me with some feedback. Would love to hear your thoughts! Cheers!
